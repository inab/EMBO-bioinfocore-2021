# Introduction

To help you make the most of the course, the following is a brief explanation of how the course is organised, the applications we are using to run the course and how you can get support. This should enable all participants to have the best possible learning experience with us. 

## About the course
This EMBO Practical Course is an opportunity for aspiring new managers of core facilities, especially those with one foot in the research camp, to learn from experienced core facilities managers how to build a framework for the future development, resourcing, operation and impact assessment of their core services. 

By the end of the EMBO Practical Course, you should be able to:
- Identify the strengths and limitations of their core facility and prioritise areas for improvement
- Design bioinformatics services and training using a user-centred approach and assuring best practices
- Estimate the computing and human resources required to operate their facility effectively
- Support your users to manage their data, including sensitive data

On the final day of the course, you will develop a personal action plan to put what they have learned into practice in their own core facilities.

## How is the course set up? 
As you can see from the programme, live sessions will take place each day on Zoom from 8:45 am to 15:30 pm.

### Platforms
**Slack:**	
- To communicate outside of live sessions and during group work time we will use Slack. Please read the [Slack help sheet](docs/help/slack/) for more information. 

**Zoom:**	
- Zoom will be used for our lectures, practical sessions and check-ins.  
- Please arrive some minutes before the session so we make sure to start with no delays. A 10 minutes slot has been scheduled before the first and second slot for you to settle in and informal discussions. 
- Make sure your screen name is your actual name as you registered for the course (no nicknames please). 
- If you are having trouble connecting, take a look at the [Zoom help sheet](/docs/help/zoom/). The slack channel #technical-support is also available for you to ask for help.
- Please mute yourself when joining to avoid background noise. The trainers will let you know how best to ask questions during the session. 
- Zoom breakout rooms will be used during some sessions. The trainers will explain more about how this will work and how to ask for help.  

**Google Docs/Spreadsheets/Slides:**
- Google utilities are often used for group editing, particularly for group projects. This handbook may provide you with links to any Google Docs you may need. 

## Where can I ask questions? 
- Post any questions that arise into the #general channel in the Slack workspace.
- The trainers will let you know how best to ask questions during the session 
- Research-related questions can be direct messaged to trainers, although there is no guarantee they will answer them. They will not write your thesis for you, but they will help you if they can. 
- If you have any other questions please contact us on slack, either using the channel #technical-support or via direct message to the @embo.bioinfocore user. Alternatively, please email [embo.bioinfocore@bsc.es](mailto:embo.bioinfocore@bsc.es)

## Our advice for making the most of this course 
- Please turn off all other internet-using devices (particularly video streaming) so you get the best signal you can for the session. 
- Carve out full days as if you were attending an onsite course. 
- Embrace the community. There are many other trainees on this course who want to start using bioinformatics in their research, so do reach out to them.
- Virtual learning and teaching is harder than face to face. There could be connection issues, technical things going wrong, people dropping out and children or pets might run in mid-way through a sentence.
- Just remember: be patient, be caring, be kind, and we will get through this together and even with a smile on our faces.

## Code of Conduct
This EMBO Practical Course follows the conduct principles defined by the [ELIXIR Code of Conduct](https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct) to guarantee a safe and respectful environment during the course.

### Applicability
The Code of Conduct is applicable at all times during the course and by using any communication channel. By participating in the course, participants accept the procedures by which the Organising Committee resolves any Code of Conduct incidents.

### Reporting Issues
Whether any person needs to report issues or incidents related to the Code of Conduct, please send an email to [embo.bioinfocore@bsc.es](mailto:embo.bioinfocore@bsc.es). The Organising Committee will take appropriate actions. Any incident of inappropriate behaviour will be taken extremely seriously and will be responded promptly.
