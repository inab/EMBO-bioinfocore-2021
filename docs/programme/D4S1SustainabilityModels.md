# Sustainability models - how to finance your core facility
## Trainer: Alex Sanchez

## Summary
Informal presentation on what sustainability means for a core facility and the different ways that this sustainability can be pursued and achieved.

## Goal
After this session the participant will:
- Improve our understanding of what sustainability means. 
- Realise that it may mean different things to each of us. 
- Reflect on how (and why) it is relevant and how it can be pursued, improved or achieved.

## What will the participant be doing?
The session will be organised in two parts:
- The first part will be a presentation of some concepts and experiences on sustainability.
- Next, participants will form small teams and be provided with a few questions they have to answer and share. Lastly, the answers will be put in common, synthesised and discussed.

## Resources needed for the session
- [Collaborative spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12b5V7KuAzRWzHVDOBhS9eM6hzlt738eYvuzDrR65jRU/edit?usp=sharing) to contribute and share participant's answers.
