# Semi-structured breakout	
## Trainers: Salvador Capella-Gutierrez and Eva Alloza with course faculty members

## Goal
This activity aim is to address topics of interest defined by participants that have not been tackled during the workshop or those presented in the course but would like to expand.

## What will you be doing?
**First**, participants will be asked to reflect on the discussions and topics tackled that day. Then, they will fill a shared list with missing topics or topics that they would like to be expanded. This process will run **iteratively every day** at the end of each training day.

**In the last session of day four**, participants will also vote for their preferred topics from the shared list. Faculty will prioritise the list according to available faculty and training materials. They will elaborate a final list presented to participants at the start of the semi-structured session.

**The Semistructured breakout session** will run in two 40 minute slots with a 10 minute break in between. Every slot can have up to 3-4 breakout rooms running in parallel with a maximum of 6 participants to promote and facilitate participation. Materials and discussion minutes will be available for those that chose other topics.
