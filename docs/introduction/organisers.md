[Eva Alloza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evaalloza/) is a training/communications/support officer at the coordination node of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB), hosted by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), which is also leading the Spanish node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-ES). She is deeply involved in the ELIXIR Training platform, deputy Head of Node, and other ELIXIR initiatives such as Impact, Industry and the Tools platform. As part of BSC, Eva is also involved in other projects, for instance, BioExcel, EuCanImage, VEIS, DECIDER and Bioinfo4Women.
Her background is as an agricultural engineer by UPC and UdL in Spain, where she was mainly interested in livestock breeding. Then she had the chance to pursue an MSc in Bioinformatics at Cranfield University and a master thesis in the microarray facility at the VUmc. Eva was a PhD candidate in functional genomics at Joaquin Dopazo’s lab at Principe Felipe Research Center (CIPF) about cancer genome functional organisation. She holds a Master’s degree in Scientific, Medical and Environmental Communication by Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), after which she managed the Bioinformatics Barcelona Association’s operations for five years. Eva is currently enrolled in several modules of the Executive Masters in Management of Research Infrastructures (EMMRI) by Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca.

Ezgi Karaca is a computational structural biologist with a specialization on integrative modeling and biomolecular dynamics. Ezgi completed her bachelor (2006) and master’s degrees (2008) at the Chemical Engineering Department of Bogazici University. For her Ph.D., she joined the group of Alexandre Bonvin (Utrecht University). Her thesis was dedicated to the incorporation of various types of experimental data into the modeling of biomolecular complexes. After her Ph.D., she moved to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Heidelberg, for carrying out her postdoctoral studies in the labs of Teresa Carlomagno (NMR) and Orsolya Barabas (X-ray Crystallography). There, she worked at the intersection of experimental and computational techniques, where she developed computational tools to translate experimental data into high-resolution structures of protein-nucleic acid machineries (2013-2016). Since May 2017, she is the principal investigator of [computational structural biology group](https://www.ibg.edu.tr/research-programs/groups/karaca-lab/) at the Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG, Turkey). Her group is focused on characterizing the factors leading to specific biomolecular recognition. In 2020, together with her two other collogues, Ezgi established IBG’s bioinformatics core facility.

## Sheila Zúñiga
### INCLIVA Health Research Institute, ES

<div style="width:150px; height: 150px; border-radius:50%; background-image:url({{'assets/images/profiles/SheilaZuniga.jpg' | relative_url}}); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: center; float: left; margin: 15px 15px 15px 0px;"></div>

[Sheila Zúñiga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheilazt/) is a senior bioinformatician with more than 14 years of experience in omics data analysis, mainly related to genetic diagnostics. After completing her undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of Salamanca (Spain) in 2003, she obtained her MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of East Anglia (Norwich, England) in 2004. She then joined one of the most successful Spanish biotech companies, where she was quickly promoted to head of the Bioinformatics Department, a position she held for 9 years. During her time in the private sector, and in parallel to her activity in the company, she obtained her PhD in Biotechnology at the University of Valencia (Spain) in 2014. In 2015, Sheila Zúñiga started her career in the public sector at the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit of the Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe. A few years later, she joined the INCLIVA Health Research Institute as head of the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Unit. Through these experiences, in addition to developing her skills in team management, she has been key in the implementation, start-up, accreditation/certification (CLIA and CE marking for NGS products, ISO standards) and dissemination of different analysis services.
