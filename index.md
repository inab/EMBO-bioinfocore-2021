# EMBO Practical Course | Research to service: Planning and running a bioinformatics core facility
{: .fs-9 }

This EMBO Practical Course is an opportunity for aspiring and newly appointed managers of core facilities, especially those with one foot in the research camp, and those managers willing to stabilise and grow their services, to learn from experienced core facilities managers how to build a framework for the future development, resourcing, operation and impact assessment of their core services.

### Computational core facilities play a vital role in enabling molecular life science, and the number of such facilities has grown considerably. There are many relatively inexperienced managers of core facilities, who often have to juggle their own research projects with the development and operation of services. This can be exceptionally challenging, not least because scientific impact tends only to be recognised and rewarded for research.


## Getting started

This course handbook will provide you with everything you need for this EMBO Practical Course, including course joining details, links to course materials, and biographies of trainers and course participants.

By the end of the EMBO Practical Course, participants will have learned how to:

1. Identify the strengths and limitations of their core facility and prioritise areas for improvement
2. Design bioinformatics services and training using a user-centred approach and assuring best practices
3. Estimate the computing and human resources required to operate their facility effectively
4. Support your users to manage their data, including sensitive data

On the final day of the course, the participants will develop a personal action plan to put what they have learned into practice in their own core facilities.
