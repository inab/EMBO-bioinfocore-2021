# Welcome

Dear participants, 

We are delighted to welcome you to the EMBO Practical Course "Research to service: Planning and running a bioinformatics core facility" in its virtual edition, as the original course can not be held in the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Spain, due to the pandemic situation. We have been working on a programme that will bring together aspiring new managers of core facilities, especially those with one foot in the research camp, and managers willing to stabilize and grow their services, to learn from experienced bioinformatics core facility managers from around the world, from each other and from potential users of your services.

The programme has been designed considering the feedback received from the first edition of this [course previously held in Izmir, Turkey, in 2019](https://meetings.embo.org/event/19-bioinformatics-core), while adding newly relevant topics and adapting it to the virtual setting. The programme provides a mixture of live-streamed lectures and practicals sessions with live support from trainers.  We hope that it will provide a positive learning experience for you and your peers, including networking opportunities via our Slack workspace.

In this handbook, you will find all the information about the course as well as the resources that we will be using to run the course. While the course will be running mainly on Zoom, we will have other communication platforms such as Slack and Google services to enhance the scientific and social interactions. This handbook will keep evolving as the course progresses; we will add course materials, collaborative shared documents, presentation slides, etc, so do keep an eye on this.

A virtual course, much like a face-to-face course, requires a significant time commitment from participants as well as trainers. Make use of the time you have with us during the course this week to build networks, make new friends and importantly learn from and contribute in your own capacity to the course.

We look forward to seeing you all virtually soon!
