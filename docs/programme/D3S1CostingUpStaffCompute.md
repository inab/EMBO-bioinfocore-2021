# Costing up staff and compute requirements
## Trainer: Sarah Butcher

## Summary
This session continues to explore the costs incurred by bioinformatics facilities – this time concentrating on direct costs for staff and compute. We will move on to introduce different opportunities for applying for grant funding, either directly or via researchers’ grants. We will present some practical tips for working on joint applications with researchers and for managing expectations during the research funding cycle.

## Goals
This talk will make you familiar with the direct costs incurred by a core facility and help you to consider how your staff and compute facilities and their funding methods interact. You should also be able to understand the main types of grant-funding that may be available to you and how to work smoothly with a researcher on a joint application.

## What will the participant be doing?
Participant will listen aspects of which will be further explored in the next practical session.
