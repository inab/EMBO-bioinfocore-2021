Prof. [Alfonso Valencia](https://www.bsc.es/valencia-alfonso) is ICREA research Professor, Director of the Life Sciences Department of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute INB/ELIXIR-ES. His research interest is the development of Computational Biology methods and their application to biomedical problems. Some of the computational methods he developed are considered pioneering work in areas such as biological text mining, protein coevolution and more recently epigenetic and disease networks. He participates in some of the key cancer related international consortia. In terms of community services, he is one of the initial promoters of what is now the ELIXIR infrastructure, founder of the Spanish Bioinformatics network and founder member and former president of ISCB the professional association of Bioinformaticians and the Executive Editor of the main journal in the field (Bioinformatics OUP).

## Andrew Hercules
Hello! I’m Andrew and I’m the Product Design and Strategy Lead for the Open Targets team at EMBL-EBI. My primary responsibility is to help the team integrate new datasets and design new features for the Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics Portal  I also coordinate other special strategy projects, including engaging with partners, roadmap planning, and measuring the impact of our research and services. Before joining EMBL-EBI, I worked in product design and web development roles at the University of London, Deloitte Digital, and the University of Toronto. I’m particularly interested in helping teams discover the benefits of design and how they can use various design practices and principles to create effective and efficient services and products. So if have specific questions about design and how it can benefit your bioinformatics services or core facility, please feel free to book a meeting in my calendar. You can also connect with me on LinkedIn.

## Celia van Gelder
Celia van Gelder is Training Programme Manager of the Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL), which is also the Dutch node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-NL), and she is leading the Training & Capacity Building Programme of Health-RI national infrastructure. She is a bioinformatics education manager, coordinator and trainer with extensive experience in initiating and managing bioinformatics education and training projects at institute, national and international level. Within DTL/ELIXIR-NL and Health-RI, FAIR data stewardship training activities have a prominent place, and three examples of current projects are 1) the development of the NPOS/ELIXIR data steward competency framework , 2) defining the Dutch Roadmap to professionalizing data stewardship in the context of the National Programme Open Science and 3) developing and delivering data stewardship training in the context of Helis Academy (project funded by Interreg).  She is co-lead of the ELIXIR Training Platform, that aims to build a sustainable training infrastructure in Europe and she leads the Training  & Capacity Building Work Package in the ELIXIR-CONVERGE project, that aims to connect and align ELIXIR Nodes to deliver sustainable FAIR life sciences data management services. In the global arena Celia is Chair of GOBLET, the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training.

## Ezgi Karaca
Ezgi Karaca is a computational structural biologist with a specialization on integrative modeling and biomolecular dynamics. Ezgi completed her bachelor (2006) and master’s degrees (2008) at the Chemical Engineering Department of Bogazici University. For her Ph.D., she joined the group of Alexandre Bonvin (Utrecht University). Her thesis was dedicated to the incorporation of various types of experimental data into the modeling of biomolecular complexes. After her Ph.D., she moved to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Heidelberg, for carrying out her postdoctoral studies in the labs of Teresa Carlomagno (NMR) and Orsolya Barabas (X-ray Crystallography). There, she worked at the intersection of experimental and computational techniques, where she developed computational tools to translate experimental data into high-resolution structures of protein-nucleic acid machineries (2013-2016). Since May 2017, she is the principal investigator of computational structural biology group at the Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG, Turkey). Her group is focused on characterizing the factors leading to specific biomolecular recognition. In 2020, together with her two other collogues, Ezgi established IBG’s bioinformatics core facility.
