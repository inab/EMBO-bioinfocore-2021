# Zoom

Zoom is a video communication platform which we will be using to host the EMBO Practical Course. Some of you may use Zoom on a regular basis and some of you might not be familiar with Zoom. This document is useful for tips and tricks for Zoom but this also details how we will be using Zoom for the course.  

## Joining Zoom

To access Zoom you do not need to sign up, simply click on the session link which can be found in the course programme. This should open up the Zoom web browser and might suggest using the Zoom desktop app, we would recommend the desktop app, and suggest downloading this before the course. If you already have Zoom downloaded, we recommend ensuring it is up to date, as later versions have extra functions.

## Once you are in Zoom

The whole course will have the same Zoom connection details which you can easily join by clicking on the link which is detailed in the course programme. Once you are in the session please ensure your name displayed is your full name (no nicknames please).

- The Zoom link for the course can be found in the programme in the course handbook.
- Please arrive some minutes before the session so we make sure to start with no delays. A 10 minutes slot has been scheduled before the first and second slot for you to settle in and informal discussions.
- If you are having trouble connecting, use the slack channel #technical_support.
- Please turn off all other internet-using devices (particularly video streaming) so you get the best signal you can for the session.
- Please mute yourself when joining to avoid background noise. The trainers will let you know how best to ask questions during the session.
- Zoom breakout rooms will be used during some sessions. The trainers will explain more about how this will work and how to ask for help.
