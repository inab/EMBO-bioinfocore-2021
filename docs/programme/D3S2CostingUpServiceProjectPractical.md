# Costing up a new service and providing costs for major projects (practical)

## Trainer: Sarah Butcher

## Summary
Two short practical exercises exploring a facility cost model and the factors to consider when costing a new project. 

## Goal
The purpose of this session is to familiarise you with some of the items you might include in a facility cost model and to provide effective contributions to project proposals.

## What will you be doing?
You will divide into breakout groups and **for the first part of the exercise**, look at a facility cost template spreadsheet which has been provided for you. By changing some of the key items included, you will explore the effects on a combined chargeout figure and reflect on how the template might be adapted for your facility’s cost model.

**For the second exercise** we will consider some different project scenarios. This time, you’ll be thinking about how to cost these projects for a grant.

You will have 20 minutes in your breakout groups to answer the following four questions:
- Outline the possible areas where work may be required
- Is there enough information? What else do you need to know?
- How would you cost the project? What resources are needed?
- How will you justify the resources that you will request?
- You will need to choose a rapporteur, who will need to report back to the main group in no more than 5 minutes

When you return to the main room, each team will be asked to **report back in no more than 5 minutes** and we will have a group discussion about our approaches.
