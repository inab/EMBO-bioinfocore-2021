# The service design process
## Trainers: Vera Matser and Andrew Hercules

## Summary
In this interactive session, participants will complete two paper-based sketching exercises, including one where they will sketch their service. They will be introduced to various service design concepts and how user empathy and understanding can guide the design - or redesign - of core facilities and services. Also, they will explore how the design process can inform and inspire the creation of training materials.

## Goal
The goal of this session is to introduce participants to the power of sketching, to help them identify hidden complexity, to provide an overview of the design process, and to discuss how design can help teams build effective and efficient training. 

## What will the participants be doing?
Participants will complete two paper-based, sketching exercises:
- Make Toast exercise 
- Sketch My Service exercise

Participants are encouraged to upload and share their sketches and discuss with the group.

After a short lecture on the design process, participants will also complete a Google-Slides based exercise:
- My Service Empathy Map 

## Resources needed for the session
This will be a Zoom-based interactive session.

Participants will require two sheets of blank paper and a marker or pen and a webcam or mobile phone to take a photo of their sketches.

Additionally, participants have access to the Google-Slides so that they can upload the pictures and their activity outputs to the following shared slides:
