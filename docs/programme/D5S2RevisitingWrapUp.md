# Revisit challenges and expectations. Select topic for post-course session. Wrap up and feedback	
## Trainers Salvador Capella-Gutierrez and Eva Alloza

## Goal
The goal of this activity is to revisit the challenges that you identified in your registration forms, agree on which ones have been (fully or partially) addressed, and make a note of any remaining priorities.

# What will you be doing?
We will poll you to determine which of your priority challenges have been addressed.
For those that have not been addressed, we well point you to resources that might support you to work on this priority.
