# Trainers: Vera Matser and Andrew Hercules

## Summary

## What will you be doing?
After an introductory activity to explore complexity, participants will sketch their service and annotate with insights.

## Resources needed for the session 
- Google slides editable by all participants
- Participants will need pen and paper and either be able to use their webcam or camera to upload pictures to the shared slides.
